Bus 119A Team 1 Project Charter

Project Background: 
Santa Clara County VTA provides transportation services to the general public in Santa Clara County in the form of bus and light-rail. Transportation routes are fixed and are generally located in the vicinity of those who depend on public transportation. As the population of San Jose continues to expand, so does the dependence on public transportation as provided by the VTA. Currently, the VTA does not have an accurate picture of where people live and work.

With the expanding population and rapid growth of companies in Santa Clara County, it is important for the VTA to understand where people work in relationship to where they live since most people use the VTA to get to and from work.  If the VTA can get a clear picture of this data, it will enable them to create more efficient bus routes, serving the most people with a finite set of resources. Data about where people live and work is available in many forms and from many sources. The VTA needs to find this data and figure out ways to parse and make sense of it in order to optimize bus routes.

Project Scope: 
	
	Functional Scope:
Create Python scripts that will scrape source sites
Locate work/home data specific to San Jose/Santa Clara County residents
Upload usable/relevant collected data sources to GitHub

	Non functional Scope: 
Present data in a readable form

	Data Scope: 
Input data through Github
URL path, Agency, Title, Detailed Description of Data, Describe how the data was collected
Explain how useful is the data.

	Project Constraints: 
No team member currently knows how to write scripts in Python
There is a limit of reliable research data that we are able to gather
Data sets required for modeling purposes may be hard to come by

	Project Assumption: 
VTA does not have any raw data document consolidated in one area
