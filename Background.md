Project Background: 
Santa Clara County VTA provides transportation services to the general public in Santa Clara County in the form of bus and light-rail. As the population of Santa Clara County continues to increase, traffic will increase unless more people rely on transportation other than cars to get to work.  

With an expanding population and companies that are growing rapidly, it is super important for the VTA to understand where people work and where they live.  Also any other data about the region can be helpful.  The more information the VTA gathers, the better able they will be to create more efficient bus routes and serve the most people with their finite set of resources. Data about where people live and work is available in many forms and from many sources. The project aims to increase the data resources available to the VTA.

Project Scope: 
	
Functional Scope:

Locate work/home data specific to San Jose/Santa Clara County residents
Locate relevant data to transportation
Describe usable/relevant collected data sources to GitHub
Create Python scripts that will pull or scrape source sites

Non functional Scope: 
Present data in a readable form

Data Scope: 
Describe Data in the Github Project
URL path, Agency, Title, Detailed Description of Data, Describe how the data was collected
Explain how useful is the data.

Project Constraints: 
No team member currently knows how to write scripts in Python
There is a limit of reliable research data that we are able to gather
Data sets required for modeling purposes may be hard to come by

Project Assumption: 
VTA does not have any raw data document consolidated in one area
